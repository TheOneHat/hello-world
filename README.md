Beginers opening repository

Hello world,
This is my opening repository. As you can see there is nothing fancy here at all.
A little about me?
I am a freelance noob,  just enjoying a bit of life in the warped lane. I started coding because a friend wanted a website and could not commit the time to build one himself, so viola, here come I.
